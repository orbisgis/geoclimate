Geoclimate proposes more than 60 geospatial indicators computed at the three spatial units.
They are used to measure morphological properties (e.g form factor) , describe spatial organizations (
distance measurements, patch metrics, shape index, spatial density, etc).
They are used to quantify the shape and pattern of urban and landscape structures
