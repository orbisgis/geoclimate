# Spatial unit 


What is a spatial unit 

As described in [Bocher et al, 2018](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.uclim.2018.01.008), three scales of analysis are used :

- the **building**
- the **block**: a set of buildings that touches (at least one point in common) ([see how it's made](./spatial_units/block.md))
- the ***Reference Spatial Unit***, also called  RSU, which is a continuous and homogeneous way to divide the space,  using topographic constraint such as roads, rail ways, vegetation and water areas in addition to administrative boundaries ([see how it's made](./spatial_units/rsu.md)).
