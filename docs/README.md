## What is Geoclimate?

Geoclimate is a set of methods and spatial processing chains for extracting climate knowledge, at the city scale and on the basis of vector data.

## Why?

Even if many other applications are possible, the two main objectives of Geoclimate are: 

1. to feed the [TEB](http://www.umr-cnrm.fr/spip.php?article199) climate model developed by [Météo France](http://www.meteofrance.com),
2. to classify the urban tissues and build the *Local Climate Zones* ([LCZ](http://www.wudapt.org/lcz/)).

To achieve these objectives, it is necessary to calculate a large number of morphological and geographical indicators at different spatial scales.

Geoclimate has been developed with this in mind and offers a turnkey solution for users to compute:

- a series of more than 60 urban indicators at three spatial scales : RSU, block and building,
- Two segmentations of the territory at the RSU scale: LCZ classification and Urban typology

## Authors

The Geoclimate chain has been developed by researchers and engineers from the french [Lab-STICC](https://www.labsticc.fr/en/index/) laboratory (CNRS UMR 6285 - DECIDE team - GIS group). They are also authors of the [OrbisGIS](http://orbisgis.org/) and [H2GIS](http://h2gis.org/) applications.

## Funding

The Geoclimate chain has been developed within the two following research projects:

- [URCLIM](http://www.urclim.eu/), part of ERA4CS, a project initiated by JPI Climate and co-funded by the European Union
- [PAENDORA](https://www.ademe.fr/sites/default/files/assets/documents/aprademeprojetsretenusen2017.pdf#page=39) , funded by [ADEME](https://www.ademe.fr/)
