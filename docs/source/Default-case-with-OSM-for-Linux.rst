Default case with OSM
=====================

This tutorial presents how to create Local Climate Zones with
OpenStreetMap data.

Two tools are available to run GeoClimate algorithms: Command Line
Interface (beginner user) and Groovy (intermediate and advanced user)

Command Line Interface
----------------------

Get Geoclimate.jar on your computer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will run the archive Geoclimate.jar in a Command Line Interface.

First, make sure Java (version 11 minimum) is installed in your
computer.

You need to download Geoclimate.jar
`here <Download.html#geoclimate-for-command-line-interface>`__.

Rename the downloaded file as “Geoclimate.jar”.

Create a folder in your documents (for instance
/home/mydirectory/Geoclimate) and place Geoclimate.jar in this folder.

Create and understand the configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to run Geoclimate, you need to write a configuration file. This
file specifies inputs, methods and outputs of Geoclimate.

An example of configuration file is presented below :

.. code:: json

   {
       "description": "Processing OSM data",
       "input": {
           "locations": [
               "Pont-de-Veyle"
           ]
       },
       "output": {
           "folder": "/tmp"
       },
       "parameters": {
           "rsu_indicators": {
               "indicatorUse": [
                   "LCZ",
                   "TEB",
                   "UTRF"
               ],
               "svfSimplified": true,
               "estimateHeight": true
           },
           "grid_indicators": {
               "x_size": 100,
           "y_size": 100,
           "rowCol": false,
           "output" : "geojson",
           "indicators" :["BUILDING_FRACTION", "BUILDING_HEIGHT",
                                  "BUILDING_TYPE_FRACTION", "WATER_FRACTION", "VEGETATION_FRACTION",
                                  "ROAD_FRACTION", "IMPERVIOUS_FRACTION", "FREE_EXTERNAL_FACADE_DENSITY",
                                  "BUILDING_HEIGHT_WEIGHTED", "BUILDING_SURFACE_DENSITY",
                                  "SEA_LAND_FRACTION", "ASPECT_RATIO", "SVF",
                                  "HEIGHT_OF_ROUGHNESS_ELEMENTS", "TERRAIN_ROUGHNESS_CLASS",
                                  "UTRF_AREA_FRACTION", "UTRF_FLOOR_AREA_FRACTION",
                                  "LCZ_PRIMARY", "BUILDING_HEIGHT_DISTRIBUTION", "STREET_WIDTH"]
            }
       }
   }

You can copy this example in a notebook and name it
“my_first_config_file_osm.json”. Place this configuration file in the
same folder than Geoclimate.jar .

Understand the configuration file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The configuration file is structured in four main parts.

-  “description” is a text that describes your process. You can name
   your process here.

-  “input” specifies the input data you will use. In this example, we
   run Geoclimate for a small village in France called Pont-de-Veyle.

-  “output” specifies the format you expect for your output (here
   “folder”) and where you want to create your output files (here in
   /tmp).

-  “parameters” specifies the output you want to calculate based on your
   reference spatial units (“rsu_indicators”) or on a grid
   (“grid_indicators”).

-  At RSU scale, we calculate the LCZ, the TEB inputs and the UTRF
   (“indicatorUse”: [“LCZ”, “TEB”, “UTRF”]). We use the simplified
   method to calculate the sky view factor (“svfSimplified”: true) and
   the method to estimate the height of buildings in OSM
   (“estimateHeight” : true).

-  With the grid approach, we specify the grid dimensions in meters
   (“x_size” and “y_size”) and the output format (“output” : “geojson”).
   Then, we specify the indicators we want to calculate for each cell of
   the grid (“BUILDING_FRACTION”, “BUILDING_HEIGHT”, “WATER_FRACTION”,
   “VEGETATION_FRACTION”, “ROAD_FRACTION”, “IMPERVIOUS_FRACTION”,
   “LCZ_PRIMARY”, “LCZ_FRACTION”).

Run Geoclimate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On your machine, open a terminal.

Go to the folder where Geoclimate.jar is located using this command line
:

``cd /home/mydirectory/Geoclimate``

Then, you can run this command line which presents you the main options
of Geoclimate :

``java -jar Geoclimate.jar -h``

   Geoclimate CLI

In order to perform your first calculations with the configuration file
above, use

``java -jar Geoclimate.jar -f my_first_config_file_osm.json -w OSM``

where the f option is used to set the path of the configuration file.

If everything runs well, you will obtain a message :
``The OSM workflow has been successfully executed``

The results of your calculations are located in you ``\tmp`` folder.
