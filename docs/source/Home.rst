=============================================
Welcome to the GeoClimate documentation!
=============================================

GeoClimate is an open‑source geospatial toolbox to compute a set of climate‑related parameters describing a territory (morphological indicators such as Sky View Factor, urban classifications such as Local Climate Zones, etc.).

GeoClimate uses vector‑based inputs. Specific workflows have been developed to automatically use
`OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org>`_ and the French
`BD Topo 2.2 and 3.0 versions <https://ign.fr/>`_ databases, but the algorithms are data‑independent, thus allowing the user to connect any vector‑based dataset.

GeoClimate is developed in the `Groovy <https://groovy-lang.org/>`_ language.

**Note :**

**The documentation is inline with the current GeoClimate code source.**

**If you are using a released version of GeoClimate please read the documentation packaged with the version you are using.**
