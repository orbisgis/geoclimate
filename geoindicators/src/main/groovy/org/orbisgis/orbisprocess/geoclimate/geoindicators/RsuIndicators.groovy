 * Process used to compute the RSU ground sky view factor such as defined by Stewart et Oke (2012): ratio of the

 * and for a grid resolution of 10 m (standard deviation of the estimate calculated to 0.03 according to
 * Bernard et al. (2018)). The density of points used for the calculation actually depends on building
 * density (higher the building density, lower the density of points). To avoid this phenomenon, we set

/**
 * Script to compute the effective terrain roughness length (z0). The method for z0 calculation is based on the
 * Hanna and Britter (2010) procedure (see equation (17) and examples of calculation p. 156 in the
 * corresponding reference). It needs the "rsu_projected_facade_area_distribution" and the
 * "rsu_geometric_mean_height" as input data.
 *
 * Warning: the calculation of z0 is only performed for angles included in the range [0, 180[°.
 * To simplify the calculation, z0 is considered as equal for a given orientation independantly of the direction.
 * This assumption is right when the RSU do not split buildings but could slightly overestimate the results
 * otherwise (the real z0 is actually overestimated in one direction but OK in the opposite direction).
