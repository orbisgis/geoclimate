/**
 * Script to compute the building closeness to a 50 m wide isolated building ("building_number_building_neighbor" = 0).
 * The step 9 of the manual decision tree for building type of the classification consists of checking whether
 * buildings have a horizontal extent larger than 50 m. We therefore introduce an indicator which  measures the
 * horizontal extent of buildings. This indicator is based on the largest side of the building  minimum rectangle.
 * We use a logistic function to avoid threshold effects (e.g. totally different result for building sizes
 * of 49 m and 51 m). The gamma and x0 parameters in the logistic function are specified after analysis of the
 * training data to identify the real size of the buildings classified as larger than 50 m in the
 * subjective training process.
 *
 * @param datasource A connexion to a database (H2GIS, PostGIS, ...) where are stored the input Table and in which
 * the resulting database will be stored
 * @param buildingTableName The name of the input ITable where are stored the building geometries
 * @param nbOfBuildNeighbors The field name corresponding to the "building_number_building_neighbor" (in the
 * "buildingTableName" ITable)
 * @param prefixName String used as prefix to name the output table
