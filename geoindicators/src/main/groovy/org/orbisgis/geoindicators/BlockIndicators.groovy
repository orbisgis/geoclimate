/**
 * This indicator is usefull for the urban fabric classification proposed in Thornay et al. (2017) and also described
 * in Bocher et al. (2018). It answers to the Step 11 of the manual decision tree which consists in checking whether
 * the block is closed (continuous buildings the aligned along road). In order to identify the RSU with closed blocks,
 * the difference  between the st_holes(bloc scale) and sum(st_holes(building scale)) indicators will be calculated.
 *
 * WARNING: this method will not be able to identify blocks that are nearly closed (e.g. 99 % of the RSU perimeter).
